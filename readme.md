## Description

_{Project uses Express to build an application that simulates flashcards to learn about Express. Routes are used to move data into templates for the defined pages. Different ways to get and move data were used such as query strings, params, cookies, and JSON objects. Username was done with session cookies and could be cleared at anytime. Public files were shared via static server for styling the user experience. Modularization of code was done via splitting of route files and extensive use of templated views to limit repeating of code. }_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Make sure you have Node.js installed.

Download the files, migrate to the folder were the files are held, and run app.js. Open your local browser to localhost:3001. Using NPM package Nodemon is recommended if editing of the files is to done.
